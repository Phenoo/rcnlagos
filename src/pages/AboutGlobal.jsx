        Remnant Christian Network 
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Remnant Christian Network (RCN) is a non-denominational ministry headquartered in Makurdi, Benue state with apostolic centres in Lagos, Kaduna, Enugu, Ibadan, Calabar and Canada and a host of mission outreaches within and outside Nigeria.
          <br />
          <br />
          Remnant Christian Network (RCN) has a singular focus to restore the prayer commission of the church in fulfillment of Jesus’ proclamation in Matthew 21: 13 that “My house shall be called the house of prayer”. It is an apostolic movement that seeks to torpedo world systems and make able ministers out of Nigeria’s youth, who will take the gospel to every nook and cranny of the earth in tandem with the divine mandate for the last apostolic dispensation, as revealed by the ancients that “Nigeria is the trigger”.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the glory of the Lord must fill the earth as the waters cover the sea; if revival must occur before the second coming of the Lord, men must watch, pray and spread the good news. This is RCN’s mandate: to raise men- intercessors, prophets, evangelists, teachers
